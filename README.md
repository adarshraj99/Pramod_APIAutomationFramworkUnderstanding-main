## How to run via Jenkins ? 

### only test_scripts have test_cases .src(source) have all others files like schemas,helpers,constants.
### In crud can write single test(Unit tests) and in integration_test integration scenarios.

### 

`Run 'pip install all pip packages' to install and then run 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' to create a freezed requirements.txt file under venv directory automatically. This is better way to create requirements.txt file as some modular dependencies will also get installed and listed in requirements.txt with version numbers.`
